# 🦕 Dine-o-saur – For people who take forever to decide what to eat and go extinct

**Dine-o-saur** is a quirky, no-login, group-based web app designed to help couples and groups effortlessly decide *where to eat*. Think of it as the love child of **Spotify’s onboarding**, **Tinder’s swipe experience**, and **Google's food universe** — all wrapped into a seamless, mobile-first experience.

> Because choosing a restaurant shouldn't take longer than dinner itself.

## 🍽️ What It Does

- **Start or Join a Room**: Instantly generate a session and share a code — no login needed
- **Pick Your Tastes**: Choose from a colorful range of food preferences (like picking your vibe)
- **Swipe to Decide**: Flip through curated restaurant cards, one swipe at a time
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Your group swipes, the app listens, and consensus is served
- **Top Picks That Match the Mood**: The best-rated choices rise to the top — spicy, sweet, or somewhere in between

## 🧠 How It’s Made

Dine-o-saur is built using:
- **Next.js 14 App Router** for seamless routing and fast UX
- **Tailwind CSS** for stylish, responsive UI with personality
- **Framer Motion** to make swipes feel as smooth as butter naan
- **Firebase Firestore** (and optionally Supabase) for room syncing and real-time data
- **Zomato API** (planned) to deliver authentic and relevant restaurant data, tuned for Indian cities

We’ve focused on **minimal friction**, **mobile-first design**, and a sprinkle of wit — because group decisions shouldn’t be boring.

## 🎉 Why Use Dine-o-saur?

- Because asking *"kya khana hai?"* 10 times gets old.
